CODE ANALYSIS: 
The text file name is hardcoded
The function readFile is used inorder to get the contects of the file
ReadFile function:
while the file has a next line
the line is insterted into a stringstream
while the string stream has a word
we check if the word starts with any of the digits 1 through 9
if it does we add it to the operands array, but first we convert it from hex to a long int with the function wordToInt
if not we add it to the op string
checks the op word and performs the operation according to op

wordToInt function:
takes as argument a string which is out hex number
saves in num the substring without the 0x
convert the hex num with std::hex and passes it into a stringstream
we pass the stringstream into the long number variable and

intoToHexString function:
takes as arguments a long number 
converts the number to hex and passes the number in a stringstream 
converts the stringstream into a string and stores it  in the string result
returns result

contain function:
takes as arguments a word and an array
checks if the word contains any of the elements of the array  

add, sub, bitAnd, bitor, bitXor:
parameters are the array containing the register values and the array r containing the registers mentioned in the instruction
the array r contains register strings in the form RX. In order toupdate the registers we need to know X. which is read in the first 2 lines of the functions.
then the operands are beeing read using the indexes found in the previous steps
the calculation is being permormed and then the index of the destination register is read
the destination register is being updated
the updated registers array is being printed.

asr, lsr, lsl:
parameters are the array containing the register values, the array r containing the registers mentioned in the instruction and the number of shifts 
the index of the destination register is read
the index of the register to be shifted is read
get the number to be shifted
shifts number 
the destination register is being updated
the updated registers array is being printed.
